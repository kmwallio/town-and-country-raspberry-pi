{"name":"Raspberry Car Pi","tagline":"Push aware media client for my raspberry pi.","body":"# Town and Country Raspberry Pi\r\n\r\nThis is a collection of scripts for managing and consuming media content\r\non a Raspberry Pi Client located in a Chrysler Town & Country 2005, or\r\nany other compatible vehicle.\r\n\r\nIt's really chopped together...\r\n\r\nThe code has been tested on a Model B Raspberry Pi in a 2005 Chrysler\r\nTown and Country.\r\n\r\nInternet connection is not required, but **highly** recommended.  By\r\ndefault, the script will shuffle music located on the device.  To\r\ncontrol playback, manage playlists, watch movies, or push new content\r\nto the device, an internet connection is needed.  So you need it for\r\nat least the initial setup and updates, but not for when you're\r\ndriving out in the middle of nowhere.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nYou will need:\r\n\r\n* mpg123\r\n* omxplayer\r\n* Perl\r\n  * DBD::SQLite\r\n  * MP3::Tag\r\n  * Net::EasyTCP\r\n  * JSON\r\n* espeak\r\n* cURL\r\n\r\nGit clone, or download and copy the contents of this project to your\r\nRaspberry Pi.  Edit `client.pl` to fit your paths and settings.  Create\r\na script for automatic startup of `client.pl`.\r\n\r\n## Managing Your Pi\r\n\r\nInstall the server on your box somewhere, and make sure to have\r\npointed your client install to it.  Manage content from the\r\nserver.\r\n\r\n## Why?\r\n\r\nOne of the problems I have and have noticed is people trying to\r\nmanage their media while driving.  It's pretty dangerous, especially\r\nwith how everything is touch screens now.  I found that an iPod\r\nshuffle works well for me, but charging it, keeping it in sync,\r\nand a lot of other things are hard to do.  Plus, I drive a mini-van\r\nand it'd be cool to be able to watch videos.\r\n\r\nApple TV and Chromecast require constant internet connection, and they\r\ndon't store the content on the box.  A Raspberry Pi seemed cheap\r\nenough and powerful enough to do what I wanted.  It was just a matter\r\nof hacking something together to put on it.  My phone could act as\r\na hotspot, and would let it sync it's content.\r\n\r\nPassengers could connect to the URL I give and control what's playing.\r\n\r\nSo I though it'd be a neat experiment.\r\n\r\n## Potential Plans\r\n\r\n* Add content locally, instead of 'Push'\r\n* Gesture control to keep drivers off their phones (need to see if Pi can\r\n  handle it)?\r\n* Graphics for 'What's Playing' and 'What's Next'\r\n* PodCast subscriptions?\r\n* More settings in DB instead of hard coded\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
